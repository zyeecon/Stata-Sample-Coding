Self-rated health, in general, is the question asking how one would rate their health on a scale from poor to very healthy. Self-rated health, also known as SRH, has been found to be a strong predictor of mortality in a number of studies. Social comparison is a subgroup of social capital, which mainly focuses on the comparisons to people whom you know well or closely interact with.This paper studies how comparisons affect self-perception of health. The study finds that when people around you feel their health worsen, respondentsâ€™ self-rated health also become worsened. Additionally, self-reports of poor health versus excellent health are confounded by factors such as education levels and income settings. More educated people and those with higher incomes tend to rate themselves healthier.
